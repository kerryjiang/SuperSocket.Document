                     type="SuperSocket.SocketEngine.Configuration.SocketServiceConfig, SuperSocket.SocketEngine" />

            </servers>
            <serverTypes>
                <add name="TelnetServer"
                     type="SuperSocket.QuickStart.TelnetServer_StartByConfig.TelnetServer, SuperSocket.QuickStart.TelnetServer_StartByConfig"/>
            </serverTypes>
        </superSocket>
        <startup>
            <supportedRuntime version="v4.0" sku=".NETFramework,Version=v4.0" />
        </startup>
    </configuration>

## Root Configuration

The configuration node "superSocket" is the root of the SuperSocket configuration, it defines the global parameters of SuperSocket requires. Let me explain all the attributes of the root node:

* maxWorkingThreads: maximum working threads count of .NET thread pool
* minWorkingThreads: minimum working threads count of .NET thread pool
* maxCompletionPortThreads: maximum completion threads count of .NET thread pool
* minCompletionPortThreads: minimum completion threads count of .NET thread pool
* disablePerformanceDataCollector: whether disable performance data collector
* performanceDataCollectInterval: performance data collecting interval (in seconds, default value: 60)
* isolation: SuperSocket instances isolation level
       None - no isolation
       AppDomain - server instances will be isolated by AppDomains
* logFactory: the name of default logFactory, all log factories are defined in the child node "logFactories" which will be introduced in following documentation


## Servers Configuration
In the root configuration node, there is child node named "servers", you can define one or many server configuration nodes in it which represent app server instances. The server instances can be same AppServer type, also can be different AppServer types.
All server node's attributes:

* name: the name of the server instance
* serverType: the full name the AppServer's type which you want to run
* serverTypeName: the name of the selected server types, all server types should be defined in serverTypes node which will be introduced in following documentation
* ip: the ip of the server instance listens. You can set an exact ip, you also can set the below values
      Any - all IPv4 address
      IPv6Any - all IPv6 address
* port: the port of the server instance listens
* listenBacklog: the listen back log size
* mode: the socket server's running mode, Tcp (default) or Udp
* disabled: whether the server instance is disabled
* startupOrder: the server instance start order, the bootstrap will start all server instances order by this   value
* sendTimeOut: sending data timeout
* sendingQueueSize: the sending queue's maximum size
* maxConnectionNumber: maximum connection number the server instance allow to connect at the same time
* receiveBufferSize: receiving buffer size
* sendBufferSize: sending buffer size
* syncSend: sending data in sync mode, default value: false
* logCommand: whether log command execution record
* logBasicSessionActivity: whether log the session's basic activities like connected and closed
* clearIdleSession: true or false, whether clear idle sessions. Default value is false.
* clearIdleSessionInterval: the clearing timeout idle session interval. Default value is 120, in seconds.
* idleSessionTimeOut: The session timeout period. Default value is 300, in seconds.
* security: Empty, Tls, Ssl3. The security option of the socket server. Default value is empty.
* maxRequestLength: The maximum allowed request length. Default value is 1024.
* disableSessionSnapshot: Indicate whether disable session snapshot. Default value is false.
* sessionSnapshotInterval: The interval of taking session snapshot. Default value is 5, in seconds.
* keepAliveTime: The interval of keeping alive. Default value is 600, in seconds.
* keepAliveInterval: The interval of retry after keep alive fail. Default value is 60, in seconds.
* certificate: it is a configuration element for X509Certificate which will be used in this server instance
    
    there are two usage:

    - one is load certificate from cert file

              <certificate filePath="localhost.pfx" password="supersocket" />

    - another one is load certificate from local certificate storage

              <certificate storeName="My" thumbprint="â€Žf42585bceed2cb049ef4a3c6d0ad572a6699f6f3"/>


* connectionFilter: the name of the connection filter you want to use for this server instance, multiple filters should be delimited by ',' or ';'. Connection filters should be defined in a child nodes of root node which will be introduced in the following documentation

* commandLoader: the name of the command loader you want to use for this server instance, multiple loaders should be delimited by ',' or ';'. Command loaders should be defined in a child nodes of root node which will be introduced in the following documentation

* logFactory: the log factory you want to use for this server instance. If you don't set it, the log factory defined in root configuration will be used

* listeners: it is an configuration element which is designed for supporting multiple listening ip/port pair  in one server instance. The listeners node should contains one or more child nodes of listener whose attributes defined like below:

        ip: the listening ip
        port: the listening port
        backlog: the listening back log size
        security: the security mode (None/Default/Tls/Ssl/...)
    
    for examples:

        <server name="EchoServer" serverTypeName="EchoService">
          <listeners>
            <add ip="Any" port="2012" />
            <add ip="IPv6Any" port="2012" />
          </listeners>
        </server>


* requestFilterFactory: the name of the request filter factory you want to use it for this server instance

## Server Types Configuration
Server types node is a collection configuration node under the root. You are able to add one/more elements with element name "add" and attributes "name" and "type":

        <serverTypes>
            <add name="TelnetServerType"
                 type="SuperSocket.QuickStart.TelnetServer_StartByConfig.TelnetServer, SuperSocket.QuickStart.TelnetServer_StartByConfig"/>
        </serverTypes>


Because of the defined server type's name is "TelnetServerType", you can set the config attribute "serverTypeName" of the server instances you want to run as this type to be "TelnetServerType":

        <server name="TelnetServerA"
                serverTypeName="TelnetServerType"
                ip="Any"
                port="2020">
        </server>


## Log Factories Configuration
Same as server type configuration, you also can define one or more log factories and use it in server, the only one difference is the log factory also can be set in root configuration:

    <logFactories>
      <add name="ConsoleLogFactory"
           type="SuperSocket.SocketBase.Logging.ConsoleLogFactory, SuperSocket.SocketBase" />
    </logFactories>

Use it in root configuration:

    <superSocket logFactory="ConsoleLogFactory">
        ...
        ...
    </superSocket>


Use it in server node:

    <server name="TelnetServerA"
           logFactory="ConsoleLogFactory"
           ip="Any"
           port="2020">
    </server>
